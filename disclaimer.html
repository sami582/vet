                            <p class="mt-2 text-red-700">PawPlan is a platform that facilitates connections between pet owners and veterinary care providers. We do not provide veterinary medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">No Veterinary-Client-Patient Relationship</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Use of the PawPlan platform does not create a veterinary-client-patient relationship between PawPlan and any user. All veterinary services are provided by independent licensed veterinarians and veterinary clinics who are solely responsible for the care and treatment of your pets.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Not a Substitute for Professional Veterinary Care</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">The information provided on the PawPlan platform is for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional veterinary advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of a qualified veterinarian with any questions you may have regarding your pet's medical condition or treatment.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Emergency Situations</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">If your pet is experiencing a medical emergency, immediately contact your local veterinary emergency clinic or animal hospital. Do not rely on the PawPlan platform for emergency veterinary care. In case of emergency, contact:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>Your local veterinary emergency clinic</li>
                    <li>ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center: (888) 426-4435</li>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Limitation of Information Accuracy</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information about veterinary services and membership plans, we make no representations or warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any information on our platform. Veterinary providers are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their service descriptions and pricing.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Service Provider Independence</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">PawPlan is an independent platform that connects users with veterinary service providers. We do not control, operate, or manage veterinary clinics or the services they provide. Veterinary providers are independent businesses that set their own prices, policies, and service standards.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">No Warranty or Guarantee</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">PawPlan makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the veterinary services provided by our network providers. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee specific treatment outcomes or results.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Financial Responsibility</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">While PawPlan facilitates membership-based payment plans, users are ultimately responsible for all veterinary care costs. Membership plans do not cover all possible veterinary services, and additional charges may apply for services not included in your plan. Always confirm costs and coverage with your veterinary provider before receiving services.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Third-Party Links and Resources</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">The PawPlan platform may contain links to third-party websites, resources, or service providers. These links are provided for your convenience only. PawPlan does not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the accuracy, quality, or reliability of any third-party services or information.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Regulatory Compliance</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Veterinary providers in the PawPlan network are responsible for maintaining all necessary licenses, certifications, and insurance required to practice veterinary medicine in their jurisdiction. PawPlan does not verify the current status of professional licenses or credentials.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">In no event shall PawPlan, its officers, directors, employees, or agents be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the platform, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or goodwill, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Indemnification</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">You agree to indemnify and hold harmless PawPlan, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from your use of the platform or your violation of these terms.</p>
